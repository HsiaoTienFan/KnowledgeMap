## Overview
The Monte Carlo Method is a class of computational algorithm that uses repeated random sampling of a process to get numerical results. The idea is to sample a process randomly, but frequently enough to gain obtain a numerical answer that ends up being close to the deterministic answer.

**General Approach**
1. Define the domain of interest.
2. Sample randomly and repeated from the probability distribution of the domain
3. Compute and aggregate the samples for results.
